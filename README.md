# Portfolio-Rotatoin-Strategy

This strategy implements a fully automated, time-based trading system that allocates capital across sector and regional ETFs based on consistent intraday performance patterns. It deploys two distinct portfolios each trading day: an Intraday Portfolio, activated shortly after the market open, and an After-Hours Portfolio, executed just before the close. Each portfolio is constructed from a curated set of ETFs—covering U.S. growth, international markets, commodities, and specific sectors—and weighted to reflect normalized exposure across macro themes. The system uses Alpaca’s API to monitor the clock, liquidate all positions at key points, and execute limit orders with predefined weightings. By allocating only to ETFs, the strategy emphasizes broad exposure and liquidity while minimizing idiosyncratic stock risk. This approach allows for targeted participation in sectors that statistically outperform at certain times of day, while avoiding overnight and weekend exposure through daily rebalancing and timed liquidation.
